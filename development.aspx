                Following the success of <i>Wildlands</i>, the development team
          expanded to more than one thousand people. For the first time in the
          series, the setting is fictional as the team felt that they would have
          more creative freedom regarding the game's world design. The
          development team created a backstory for the Auroa archipelago dating
          back eighty million years to make the setting feel more realistic. The
          game world itself was created through procedural generation with some
          areas developed from the ground up. An archipelago was chosen for the
          game's setting as it would make it easier for the developers to add
          post-game content by adding additional islands and open up new regions
          for exploration. The development team also listened to players'
          feedback from <i>Wildlands</i> and introduced a variety of changes
          players had requested, such as an increased focus on realism and
          improved vehicle control. The game's premise of the Ghosts being
          hunted and alone on the island caused Ubisoft to remove AI companions
          from the game. According to executive producer Nouredine Abboud, Jon
          Bernthal was hired to voice and provide motion capture for the game's
          antagonist because the team felt that he had the potential to be a
          charismatic villain and an effective nemesis for the Ghosts. The name
          of the game, <i>Breakpoint</i>, reflects the game's narrative in which
          the Ghosts are on a mission which is on the brink of failure. Emil
          Daubon, the game's writer, added that the story would explore the
          themes of "pain, trauma, brotherhood, and mental exhaustion". After
          the game's release and in response to its poor critical reception,
          Ubisoft announced plans to rework <i>Breakpoint</i> with the
          introduction of "the Ghost Experience". The Ghost Experience allows
          players the option to disable some game mechanics, such as the gear
          score, and independently alter others.
