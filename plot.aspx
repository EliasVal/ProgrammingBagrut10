                Prior to the events of the game, Skell Technology comes under
          increasing public scrutiny when they are faced with mounting evidence
          that its products are being used by corrupt regimes. The situation
          escalates further when the USS Seay, an American cargo ship, sinks off
          the coast of the Auroa archipelago, and the entire island chain cuts
          all communication to the outside world. In response, CIA Deputy
          Director Peter Miles initiates Operation Greenstone, deploying a Ghost
          Recon platoon to re-establish contact with Auroa and determine the
          circumstances of the sinking. The insertion ends in disaster when the
          helicopters carrying the platoon to the island are taken down by a
          swarm of drones. Nomad survives the crash, but Midas is missing in
          action, Holt is crippled, and Weaver is executed by Cole Walker, a
          former Ghost-turned-leader of an elite paramilitary group called the
          "Wolves." Nomad gets in contact with Mads Schulz, an ex-United States
          Marine and de facto leader of the homesteaders who lived on Auroa
          before Skell Tech's arrival. Mads reveals that the homesteaders were
          forced into hiding by a private military company employed by Skell
          Tech called Sentinel, who had been hired for security following a
          terrorist bombing on the island, but has now overthrown Skell Tech and
          declared martial law over the entire archipelago. Nomad meets Josiah
          Hill, another Ghost survivor with whom he and Walker have history: The
          three were part of a mission in the Middle East, which ended in
          disaster when Walker executed their commanding officer for murdering a
          civilian, after which Walker resigned and disappeared. Nomad then
          encounters Skell's chief mathematician Maurice Fox and his daughter,
          Harmony, and discovers that all of Auroa is surrounded by a massive
          network of drones that prevents anyone from entering or leaving. After
          determining that Skell Tech CEO Jace Skell, who disappeared shortly
          after Sentinel's coup, is the only one who can lift the drone
          perimeter, Nomad seeks him out. Upon reaching Skell, Nomad discovers
          that Hill has been secretly working with Walker and the two offer
          Nomad a place by their side. Nomad refuses and evacuates Skell to
          Erewhon. Skell reveals that he was responsible for the sinking of the
          Seay due to it carrying dangerous technology off the island, but shows
          Nomad video footage in which Walker and Trey Stone, the founder and
          owner of Sentinel, discuss a project codenamed "Wonderland." Skell
          then says that he will be able to hack one of the pylons that controls
          the drone perimeter, but needs the assistance of several Skell Tech
          colleagues who are currently scattered around the islands. During the
          search for one of the employees, Nomad reaches out to the Outcasts, a
          group of former Skell Tech employees who quit Skell Tech and formed a
          resistance group in opposition to Skell's increasing interests in
          transhumanism, led by Haruhi Ito and her brother Diagoroh. While
          assisting one of Skell's colleagues, Nomad discovers Haruhi and
          Diagoroh were responsible for the Skell Tech bombing; they had
          intended only to severely damage the building as a protest against
          Skell's transhumanist projects, but they were not aware the building
          was occupied and had underestimated the explosive power of their bomb.
          Nomad berates them for their recklessness, but continues working with
          them after recovering Skell's colleague. Maurice reveals the identity
          of a mole in Skell Tech who had been assisting him and attempts to
          meet her, but he is killed by the Wolves and the mole is kidnapped.
          Nomad rescues her, killing Hill in the process, and continues to
          investigate the Wolves' activities. Nomad eventually discovers that
          Walker's "Wonderland" project is an operation to use a submarine
          outfitted with drone-equipped torpedoes to assassinate key national
          figures, in hopes of triggering a third world war as a way of
          "cleaning" the world and ridding it of corruption. After finding and
          killing Walker, Nomad assists Skell in hacking the drone pylon, using
          the drones to destroy Walker's submarine before it departs. In the
          wake of Walker's death, Stone consolidates his power over Auroa, Skell
          Tech, and Sentinel. Nomad returns to Erewhon and is congratulated for
          thwarting the Wonderland Scheme, but acknowledges that his work on
          Auroa is not finished. Skell observes the drone swarm above Auroa
          acting strangely, commenting that the hacked pylon appears to have
          developed emergent behavior.
